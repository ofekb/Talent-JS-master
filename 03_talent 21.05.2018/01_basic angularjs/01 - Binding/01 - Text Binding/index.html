<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- ng-... is called "Directive".
    ng-app tells AngularJS to be active anywhere inside this element.
    In this case the entire document: -->
<html ng-app>
<head>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.5.5/angular.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

    <label>Enter your first name: </label>

    <!-- ng-model links the input element and the model.
        This means that any changes to the control update the data in your model,
        and when you change the model it updates the control: -->
    <input type="text" ng-model="firstName"> 

    <!-- The {{ }} are called "Expressions".
        They are a declarative way of specifying data binding locations in the HTML.
        AngularJS will automatically update this text whenever binded model changes: -->
    <h2>Hello {{firstName}}</h2>

</body>
